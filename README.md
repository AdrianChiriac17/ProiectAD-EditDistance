The application functions in 2 working regimes:
• User Input
• Between 2 and 5 randomly chosen words from a list
1) For the first regime, the user is prompted with the question ”Input the rule string:” and after that ”Input the
fragment code:”. (For example, the rule string is ”func(myFunction)” and the fragment code is ”fnuc(myFuncion”).
The program is going to output ”3”, because there are 3 steps to accomplish this which are explained in the
document:
• Reversing the characters ”n” and ”u”
• Adding the letter ”t”
• Adding the character ”)”
Therefore there are 3 operations.
2) In the second regime, the program takes its data from a .txt file using file pointer. In the .txt file there are
1000 randomly generated words. The program then chooses a random number between 2 and 5 (this will be the
number of words in the string). The individual words are then randomly chosen with an ”index=rand()MOD1000”
and concatened to the rule string. The code fragment is then generated by a ”similar string generator” that we
will explain in a different section to make sure all the details are clear.
